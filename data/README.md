# Macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits model (/data folder)
## Description
Multiscale model of the macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits developed using NetPyNE (www.netpyne.org).

The model is described in the following publication:

Dura-Bernal S, Griffith EY, Barczak A, Oâ€™Connell MN, McGinnis T, Moreira JV, Schroeder C, Lytton WW, Lakatos P, Neymotin SA. (2023) **Data-driven multiscale model of macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits reproduces in vivo dynamics.** Cell Reports (In Press)


## Downloading the data
All the experimental data and data generated by the model has been made publicly available online at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10066993

## Overview of file structure:

The structure of the /data folder is as follows:

* /v34_batchX: Output data generated by the model simulations, and required to reproduce the paper results.

* /ICoutput: Output of phenomenological model of cochlea and inferior colliculus (UR_EAR tool) in response to input .wav sound files. Used as input to the NetPyNE-based biophysically detailed thalamocortical model.

* /NHPdata: Non-human primate experimental data used for validation of model results, and required to reproduce the paper results.
