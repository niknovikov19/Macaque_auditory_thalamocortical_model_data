# Macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits model (/analysis folder)
## Description
Multiscale model of the macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits developed using NetPyNE (www.netpyne.org).

The model is described in the following publication:

Dura-Bernal S, Griffith EY, Barczak A, Oâ€™Connell MN, McGinnis T, Moreira JV, Schroeder C, Lytton WW, Lakatos P, Neymotin SA. (2023) **Data-driven multiscale model of macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits reproduces in vivo dynamics.** Cell Reports (In Press)


## Setup and execution

This code can be used to reproduce the analysis and figures in the paper. It requires having access to the experimental data and data generated by the model -- see /data/README.md for instructions on how to download. 

Some analysis functions requires NetPyNE; see installations instructions here: http://netpyne.org/install.html#

The file **paper_figs.py** contains the Python source code to generate the results in all the paper figures. It makes use of several other Python files in the analysis folder.
